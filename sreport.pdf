Short report :
    The data collected shows that there was no missing values and all the data was standardized and then model was trained on it.
The first column was the id of the corn samples and hence it was removed. I proceeded with applying MLP and xgboost on the data and 
found the results to be - R2 score 0.59 .We performed the SHAP analysis and basic check on the data. Standardized the data and pickled
 the scalers and model after training. All the files are intact in this repository.
 A streamlit application is also there which asks the user to upload the test.csv and show them the results and download them too.
